# IOS Calculator
Is a calculator app that aims to mimic the interface of the IOS calculator using CSS grid and pure JavaScript.
The Calculator is divided in two main files: 
- One is the ```app.js``` which contains the logic for the app.
- The second one is the ```engine.js``` which contains the engine for processing the math expressions.
  It uses infix to postfix notation conversion and then evaluates the result.
